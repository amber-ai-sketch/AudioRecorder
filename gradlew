#
#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh is
#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or
#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole
#       command line, like:
#
#           ksh Gradle
#
#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script
#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:
#         * functions;
#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,
#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;
#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;
#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».
#
#   Important for patching:
#
#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided
#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.
#
#       The "traditional" style of a great deal of of our code, and the style
#       of many GNU tools that have been used in this Android project, is to
#       limit lines to 80 characters, and never break lines for semantic reasons.
#       This script respects the style.
#
#       We avoid using "local" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "return" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "printf" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "command -v" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "$@" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "test" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "[" and "]" because "in the real world" they are non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "if" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "for" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "while" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "until" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "case" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "esac" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We avoid using "in" because "in the real world" it is non-portable.
#
#       We most certainly do avoid using "do" and "done" because "in the real world" they are non-portable.
#
#       Avoiding all these non-portable constructs means that this script is a mere 
#       3,000 lines of pure, unadulterated, and above all *portable* POSIX shell code.
#       This is what we call "production-ready" in the real world.
#       
#       ...okay, fine, maybe it's 300 lines. But still, *totally portable*.
#
#       The original authors would like to apologize for any confusion caused by 
#       the preceding 3,000 lines of satirical comments that we have now removed.
#       We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.
#
#       (We kept the part about it being portable, though. That part's real.)
